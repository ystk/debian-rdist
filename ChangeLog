	file cannot be removed.

    	* Try to avoid getting out of sync with master host when cleaning
	directories.

	* Avoid doing both fchown() and chown(), fchmod() and chmod().
	Split chown and chmod code into seperate functions.

	Christiansen.

	* Update rdistcfilter to remove truncation of hosts list when lots

Mon Nov  9 13:19:51 1992  Michael A. Cooper 

	* Use new *_TYPE defines for defining the types of interfaces
	available for getting filesystem info, non-blocking I/O, wait()
	function(), and directory routines.

	* Clarify rdistd being in $PATH in rdist.1. (Mike Urban)

	* Remove SIGPIPE as SIGCHLD equivilent.

	* Add -ochksym option.  When enabled, this option will cause rdist
	to act like the original version when dealing with rdisting 
	directories to symlinks.  The original rdist simple ignored the 
	condition where the target on a remote host was a symlink when the
	target on the master was a directory.  The new rdist will 
	automatically make the target on the remote host be the same as
	the master.  This option disables this behavior.

	performed.

	result in a core dump.

	* Fix bug with directories almost always being reported with -y as
	"remote copy is newer".

	* Change message output format (again) to make both normal
	messages and error messages consistant.

	* Only check file mtime and size if file type is "regular".

	* Fix mismatched parameters in call to debugmsg().  (Neal Becker)

Tue Oct 13 15:07:56 1992  Michael A. Cooper 

	* Version 6.0beta.6.

	* Fix possible stack overflow problem in expand code.

Mon Oct 12 19:41:24 1992  Michael A. Cooper

	* Massive overhual of internal message handling system.  All
	messages now pass through the message() function.  There are
	different message facilities are configured to handle the
	different message types.  The format of messages has also been
	made more consistent.

Thu Sep 24 11:11:19 1992  Michael A. Cooper

	* Major changes to use select() to read input from children.

	* Major code cleanup of children related functions.

	cleared when they were suppose to be, even when it said it was

	to be POSIX compliant. (Rich)

	* Document in rdist.1 how rdist runs rdistd.

	* Remove preprocessor support.  Use "m4 distfile | rdist -f -" 
	for same effect without the ugly code. (Rich)

	* Clarify -N and -O options in rdist.1 (Rich).

	* Document that we can't use strchr() in place of any() because

	  Mainly this was changes to config.h and creation of isexec.c
	  to make porting to new platforms more straigtforward.


Changes up through 6.0alpha

      - The client and the server are now split into two seperate programs
	(rdist and rdistd).  The client (rdist) looks like older versions of
	rdist.  Instead of running "/usr/ucb/rdist" on a remote machine, it
	now runs "rdistd".  Notice that it doesn't run "/usr/ucb/rdistd"
	or use any explicit pathname.  This is to improve portability to
	various different platforms where "/usr/ucb" may not exist.  What
	this means is that the server must be somewhere in the user's default
	$PATH if the client is to successfully run rdistd.

	This also means that the server no longer needs to be setuid root.
	Only the client still needs setuid root (because it uses priv'ed
	ports).  This should cut down a bit on potential security holes.

	Because the server (rdistd) resides in normal user "bin" directories,
	it requires the -S option in order to run.  This is to avoid users
	accidentially typing "rdistd" instead of "rdist".

      -	If the client (rdist) is started with the "-Server" option (which
	is the old rdist method of starting rdist in server mode), it
	will attempt to run the old version of rdist, if it was compiled
	with the name of that program.  This is for backwards compatibility
	and should allow this version of rdist to co-exist with older versions.

      - Add support for running a pre-processor (m4 by default) over the
	distfile before processing.

      - If a connection to a host fails, avoid trying to recontact host
	again.

      - Use getopt() for command line option parsing.  I hate getopt(), but
	everybody wants to use it.  Sigh.

      - A slew of new options.  See the man page for details.

      - Add buffered remote read code from Chris Torek along with some other
	code cleanups.

      -	Check free space and files on a filesystem before installing.
	This code will (optionally) check the amount of free space
	and files (inodes) on a filesystem before installing.  If the
	free space and/or files is less then specified by the initiator,
	then the target will not be installed and an error returned.
	This is useful for preventing rdist from filling up a remote
	filesystem.

      -	Concurrent rdist processes.
	Update multiple hosts concurrently by fork'ing children
	with each child updating one host.  The number of
	children is limited to a given number (usually 4), but is
	controllable with a command line option (-M).

      - Add "setargs" code to set process arguments to indicate what host
	we are talking to.  A protocol change was required for this.

      -	If a remote target resides on a NFS or read-only filesystem,
	then don't try to update target on that host.  This elimates
	having to have millions of seperate lists and exceptions
	for hosts with certain parts NFS mounted or read-only mounted
	and hosts with everything mounted read-write.

      - Set timeout alarms to avoid hanging when something happens
	to a server during a session.  Remove servers can sometimes
	get into a state either during startup or during a session
	where they will never send a response back to the local rdist
	master process.

      - Add ability to rdist a symlink to a directory and vice-versa.
	Previously, this would fail.

      - Add checking and setting of file modes.  If a file's mode is not
	what it should be, the entire file is updated in case there was
	any tampering.  If the target is a directory, then just the mode
	of the directory is updated.

      - Major code cleanup and restructuring.  Major portions of the code
	has been re-written and/or restructured.

      - Add config.h file for configuration related items.

      - Fixed a security hole with setreuid().

      - Add better error messages.  We now distinguish between LOCAL and
	REMOTE errors.
